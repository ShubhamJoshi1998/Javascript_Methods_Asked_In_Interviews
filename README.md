# Javascript_Methods_Asked_In_Interviews

# tostring() Method:
 toString() method converts an array to a string of array Values
 
```javascript
//toString():

let arr = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
console.log("toString() : ", arr.toString());
```

# join method()
 join() method is same as toString() method, but we can specify a seprator also.It can be anything like ", / + -"
 
 ```javascript
//join():

let arr1 = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
console.log("join() : ", arr.join("/"))
```

# pop() method
 pop() method removes the last element from an array.This method returns the value that was popped out.

  ```javascript
//pop():

let arr2 = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
console.log(arr2.pop());  //returns the value that was popped out 
console.log(arr2); 
```

# push() method()
push() method add a new element in the array. This method returns the length of array

  ```javascript
//push():

let arr3 = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
console.log(arr3.push("f"));
console.log(arr3);
```

# shift() method
shift() method is same as pop(), but it removes the first element instead of last. This method returns the value that was shift out.

  ```javascript
//shift():

let arr4 = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
console.log(arr4.shift());
console.log(arr4);
```

# unshift() method
unshift() method is same a push(), but it adds a new element in the array at first This method returns the length of array.

  ```javascript
//unshift():

let arr5 = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
console.log(arr5.unshift("f"));
console.log(arr5);
```

# delete() method
Array elements can be deleted using javascript operator delete.This method returns true. Deleting elements leaves undefined holes in the array.

  ```javascript
//delete():

let arr6 = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
console.log(delete arr6[0]);
console.log(arr6);
```

# concat() method
concat() method returns a new array by merging existing array. This method does not change the existing array.It always returns a new array.

  ```javascript
//concat():

let arr7 = ["a","b","c"];
let arr8 = ["d","e"];
console.log(arr7.concat(arr8));
```

# splice() method
splice method is used to change the contents of an array by removing, replacing and adding new element at the specified index.

SYNTAX : array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...);
This method returns the deleted elements.

  ```javascript
//splice():

let arr9 = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ];
let arrsplice = arr9.splice(1,2,"e","f");
console.log(arr9);
console.log(arrsplice);
```

# slice() method
slice method extracts a section of an array into a new array.It does not modify the existing array.

SYNTAX : array.slice(start, end);

  ```javascript
//slice():

let arr10 = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd','e','f' ];
console.log(arr10.slice(1,4));
```

# spread operator
spread operator expands an array into its individual elements.

  ```javascript
//spread operator(...):

let arr11 = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ];
console.log("spread operator",...arr11);
```

# for of operator
This method iterates through the collection, and provides you the ability to modify specific items.

  ```javascript
//for of operator():

let arr12 = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ];
for(const item of arr12){
    console.log("for of operator",item) 
}
```

# map() method
This method creates a new array with the result of calling a providing function on every elements in the array.

 ```javascript
//map():

let arr13 = [1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(arr13.map(ele =>ele + 30));
```

# filter() method
This method creates a new array with only elements that passes the condition inside the providing function.

 ```javascript
//filter():

let arr14 = [1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(arr14.filter(ele => ele<=4));
```

# sort() method
This method is used to sort array's element either in ascending or descending order.

 ```javascript
//sort():

let arr15 = [4,2,5,1,3];
console.log(arr15.sort((a,b) => a>b ? 1:-1)); //ascending.
console.log(arr15.sort((a,b) => a>b ? -1:1)); //descending.
```

# forEach() method
This method helps to loop over array by executing a provided callback function for each element in an array.

SYNTAX : array.forEach(callback(currentValue, index, array), thisArg);

 ```javascript
//forEach():

let arr16 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
arr16.forEach(ele => {
    console.log(ele);  
});
```

# every() method
This method checks every element in the array that all elements passes the condition returns true or false.

 ```javascript
//every():

let arr17 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
console.log(arr17.every(ele => ele < 6));
```

# includes() method
This method checks that the passes condition includes the elements or not, returning true or false.

 ```javascript
//includes():

let arr18 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
console.log(arr18.includes(4));
```

# some() method
This method checks if atleast one element in the array that passes the condition returning true or false.

 ```javascript
//some():

let arr19 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
console.log(arr19.some(ele => ele >3));
```

# reduce() method
This method applies a function against accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a given value.

 ```javascript
//reduce():

let arr20 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
console.log(arr20.reduce((acc,value) => acc+value));
```

# find() method
This method returns the value of first element in the array that pass the test in the testing function

 ```javascript
//find():

let arr21 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
console.log(arr21.find(ele => ele < 4));
```

# findIndex() method
This method returns the index of first element in the array that pass the test in the testing function.

 ```javascript
//rindIndex():

let arr22 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
console.log(arr22.findIndex(ele => ele < 4));
```

# reverse() method
This method reverse an array in place. Elements in last index will be the first and vice-versa.

 ```javascript
//reverse():

let arr23 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
console.log(arr23.reverse());
```
